## Context
RPD stands for Random Play Dance. <br/>
These are socia, international, dance events where a group of people stand around in a rectangle and dance in the rectangle when they hear a song they know the dance of. <br/>
This is paired with a short countdown between each song so people have enough time to leave the area (so it is empty again) and prepare for the next song to dance to. Otherwise it would be very chaotic. <br/>
Tyically in South Korea they last an hour. <br/>
However in other countries they may be scheduled from 12:00-18:00 with several breaks and several different playlists of each 1-2 hours.

## Supported platforms and scope
- Android, iOS (Todo), Windows
- Music player will only play mp3, because it is high quality and compressed.
- Playlists will be saved locally and online.
- Only Korean, Chinese, Japanese, English and Thai songs for now.
- Dance practices for most songs included with priority for more popular songs.
- May make an account system to save and load your own playlists online.
- May add bpm per song to add countings and make animation based on bpm.

## Problems solved and benefits:
- Todo: Hours of searching and editing music/videos -> Mere minutes of making a RPD playlist by importing your songlist or searching one by one.
- Storage space saved on your phone by streaming the songs.
- Save countless playlists, see how long they are and are easily editable.
- Todo: Easy way to search up the dance practice in one place and slow it down.
- Todo: Generate your own random play dance of X hours with certain settings, instead of going to the same old youtube videos.
- Random play dance by generation (sometimes people prefer certain kpop generations, because that is when they mostly listened to kpop).
- Random play dance by company, for example someone may be a SM stan and mostly listen to SM groups, e.g. NCT, aespa, Red Velvet, etc.
- Todo: Easy way to share your playlist with other people when they have the app or send them a textual list.
- Todo: Easy way to randomize your playlist with good variety.
- Todo: Language variety (Kpop, cpop, jpop, tpop)
- Songs are 30% louder than usual, which is ideal for people with smaller speakers.
- Todo: No double songparts any more in your playlist
